## season: season (1:winter, 2:spring, 3:summer, 4:fall).
## yr: year 2011-2012.
## mnth: month ( 1 to 12).
## holiday: Indicator whether the day was a holiday or not.
## weekday day of the week.
## workingday if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.
## weathersit
    ## 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
    ## 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
    ## 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
    ## 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog
## temp Temperature in Celsius.
## hum Normalized humidity.
## windspeed Normalized wind speed.
## cnt count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered. The count is used as the target in the regression task.
## days_since_2011 Number of days since the 01-01-2011 (the first day in the dataset). This feature was introduced to take account of the trend over time.

## Interpretation

### Numerical feature
cat(paste0("Interpretation of a numerical feature (temperature): An increase of the temperature by 1 degree Celsius increases the predicted number of bicycles by ",round(coef[9,1])," when all other features remain fixed."))

### categorical feature
cat(paste0("Interpretation of a categorical feature 'weathersit': The estimated number of bicycles is ",round(coef[8,1])," lower when it is raining, snowing or stormy, compared to good weather -- again assuming that all other features do not change."))

cat(paste0("When the weather is misty, the predicted number of bicycles is ",round(coef[7,1])," lower compared to good weather, given all other features remain the same."))
