I'm a professor at the Department of Economics at Universidad ICESI and Director of the [Center for Research in Economics and Finance (CIENFI)](https://www.icesi.edu.co/cienfi/). My research focuses on development economics, big data, and machine learning, particularly in their applications to public policy.

I have extensive experience in consulting, public policy analysis, and data-driven decision-making, with a background in regulatory and financial supervision. My work bridges academia, policy, and applied data science, helping institutions leverage advanced analytics for strategic insights and decision-making.

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV-Eduard_F_Martinez_G.pdf) and my intermediate-level R course on GitHub [here](https://github.com/taller-R-202301).
