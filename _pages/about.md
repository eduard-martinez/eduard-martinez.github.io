I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics at Universidad ICESI and Director of the [Center for Research in Economics and Finance (CIENFI)](https://www.icesi.edu.co/cienfi/). My research sits at the intersection of development economics, applied econometrics, big data, and machine learning, with a focus on evidence-based public policy.

With over a decade of experience spanning academia, consulting, and public policy, I have worked with governments, regulatory bodies, and financial institutions to design data-driven strategies and policy frameworks. My work bridges rigorous economic research — including causal inference and econometric methods — with applied data science, helping organizations translate complex analytics into actionable decisions.
