I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics at Universidad ICESI and Director of the [Center for Research in Economics and Finance (CIENFI)](https://www.icesi.edu.co/cienfi). My research focuses on development economics, applied econometrics, and the use of big data and machine learning to address public policy challenges in Latin America.

My work applies causal inference methods to questions at the intersection of illicit economies, crime, and public policy. Representative examples include evaluating the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of Colombia's coca boom — finding that a surge in coca cultivation significantly raised local GDP but also drove deforestation — and assessing whether motorcycle bans across several Colombian cities effectively reduced crime, finding little evidence that they do. This kind of rigorous, policy-relevant research shapes how I engage with governments, regulatory bodies, and institutions seeking to ground their decisions in evidence.
